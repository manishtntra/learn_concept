	3.Multilevel inheritance -->In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a child class or derived class.
	4.Hierarchical Inheritance --> In Hierarchical inheritance, more than one child class is derived from a single parent class. In other words, we can say one parent class and multiple child classes.
